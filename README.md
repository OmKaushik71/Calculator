# Calculator-Neumorphic

Hello visitor. This is a simple calculator I made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The objective of this project was to practice Javascript fundamentals by making an on-screen calculator. The basic concepts used into making this project are:
- Conditionals
- Loops
- DOM Manipulation and Events
- Objects
- Arrays

For the design part I have taken inspiration from Neumorphism. Additionally, I have added a Dark and Light theme switcher using CSS variables.

Feel free to check it out. Any or all suggestions are welcome.
